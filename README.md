## User Story

As a user, I want to see a randomly shuffled deck of cards, being dealt to me and a dealer. The game should deal two cards to me and two cards to the dealer, one of whom's cards should be face down. I should then be able to ask for more cards until I bust by going over 21 or am satisfied with my hand. At that point, the automated dealer should go through a series of steps to play as a dealer in a casino would (must hit until they reach 17, and then they stop). It should then add up the totals appropriately and compare to determine whether I lose or earn my bet increment.

The count and dealer automation should both be able to handle the two possible number values for the Ace. It should successfully keep track of my bank totals.
